Test two extremes and middle ground of the conservative subproblem approach:

- One step per batch (parameter update) either by SGD/first-order-variant
  or Second-order method. Step acceptence might already be important for 
  deep/recurrent models

- Middle-ground: Multiple steps of first or second order method per batch
  (batch persistence). Modifications to SGD with step acceptance parameter 
  start being more relevant in this regime

- Full optimization for each batch, cumulative averaging over batches

spectrum should go:

Time (computation) efficient <----> Data efficient
       L = 1                           L = oo

What methods perform better at what points in the spectrum?
Can second order methods @ L = oo outperform first order @ L = 0
