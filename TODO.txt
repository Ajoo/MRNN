- Possibly implement other thrust region approaches (like iterative)
 using only matlab's pcg
- Write more efficient way to compute full bdiff 
  for entire batch or a subsample of it
- Rework PCG optimizer models to have options as properties
- Add (M)SGD implementation. Test whether non-generalization fenomena works
 the same for 1st order methods across diff. batch sizes and seq. sizes
  * if yes, try to isolate the issue. see if it's consequence of step rejection first
