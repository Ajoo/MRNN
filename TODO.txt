- Write norm constrained version of pcg to implement CG steinhaug
- Possibly implement other thrust region approaches (like iterative)
 using only matlab's pcg
- Write more efficient way to compute full bdiff 
  for entire batch or a subsample of it
- output norm(G^0.5*v) from gvp for more numerically conditioned computation
