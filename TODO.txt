- Redo RNN bdiff and fdiff so they don't require concatenation
of possibly large vectors thus incuring in time wasted on
memory copying
- Write norm constrained version of pcg to implement CG steinhaug
- Possibly implement other thrust region approaches (like iterative)
 using only matlab's pcg
- Add preconditioning
- Add possibility to start from previous initial step
 (on non thrust-region approaches)
